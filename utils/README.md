# Image Extraction Utilities

This directory contains a snapshot of the image extraction utilities that are needed for the first step of the process. I did not write these utilities and they are not subject to this project's license terms.

At time of writing, these utilities are being publicly shared in pinned posts with no specific restrictions and no specific license conveyed. However, I contacted **Scrubz** and received permission to host them in this repo (with attribution). I was told that the next version will probably contain an Open Source license statement.

One advantage of hosting them on GitHub is that I have enabled vulnerability scanning to be alerted if any issues are discovered in the future.
