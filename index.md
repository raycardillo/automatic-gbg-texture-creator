This is a companion web page for the [{{ site.github.repository_name }}]({{ site.github.repository_url }})
project. It is intended to provide a **quick start** overview to help you get
started creating your own custom Texture Nodons with a **Seeeduino XIAO**
(or other TinyUSB) board.


**[LongToothGamer also made a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/DPoPXSTAJMc) that demonstrates the process.**


# Overview
The basic process is to convert an image and extract pixel data and then paste
that data into the mouse controller program, upload it to a board, and then run
the program when attached to the Nintendo Switch.

## Image Extraction Utilities
These utilities convert an image into data that is used by the mouse controller program.

_They are hosted here for convenience but I did not write them. They were written
by **Scrubz** from the **VideoDojo** community. Review the GitHub project
**README** files for more background and full attribution._

[GBG_Texture_Builder_v1.2.html](./utils/GBG_Texture_Builder_v1.2.html)
: Converts images to texture data with several conversion options.

[Import_Textures_From_GBG_v1.1.html](./utils/Import_Textures_From_GBG_v1.1.html)
: Allows the extraction of any texture using only a screenshot of the GBG texture screen.


## Mouse Controller Program
The mouse controller program is uploaded to an Arduino or Seeeduino board and
uses the extracted image data to simulate mouse movements to automatically
create and draw Texture Nodons.

### Seeeduino XIAO
